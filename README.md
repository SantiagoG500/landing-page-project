# Landing page project

This is a landing page example and the second project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Screenshots ðŸ“¸

Here we have the original landing page

And this is my imitation of the original project

This landing page is not responsive, so it looks buggy when you resize the window into a smaller size, I don't know how it looks in mobile devices.

Perhaps in a future I'll do a new version of this site for improving it, maybe put some content I like in it!
